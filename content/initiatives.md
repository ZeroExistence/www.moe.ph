#### We are integrating some initiatives on our business model. Here are the lists of our current initiatives.

## Kiva Initiative
#### For each shirt sales that we made on our convention events, we allocate $1 to our Kiva initiative funds. We want to provide some opportunities to other Filipino farmers by lending them funds to further increase their capital. As being a family of farmers, we know the struggle that our farmers go through. By having some funds to our Kiva initiative, we are able to lend them so they can buy seeds or feeds.

#### For transparency, you can always check my Kiva lender account. All the lends that we make are on the profile page. We will also create a page that show sale statistics that is related to this program.

#### [Kiva Public Lender's Page](https://www.kiva.org/lender/anthonyhpedxc)

#### We also recommend to make a change, by creating an account on [Kiva](https://www.kiva.org). You can lend $25 to other people, and once it is fully paid, it can be used again to loan to another people. It is a great initiative.

#### Helping other people is not hard, it's just hard to help the right people.
